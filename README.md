The file GUI Final.py is the culmination of all the files and displays 2 analog meters to show the speed in KMPH and the RPM of the engine.
Comb1.ino and Comb2.ino are the Arduino files that have certain sensors connected to them(mentioned in the file) and are responsible for sending the data to the Raspberry pi.
daq_arduino1.py is a test file that just writes the data to a text file.

I used 2 arduinos for sensor data, a rasp pi to run the python scripts and an LCD screen to display the data.
